                <h1>K-Drama Review: 3 Reasons Why You Should Watch ‘Goblin’</h1>
                <h3>If you haven’t watched the drama, I will try my best to limit the spoilers as possible but if you already have watched it, maybe you’ll know what scenes and events I might be talking about. *winks*</h3>
                <h4>Written By <span class="link">Linda Paija</span> | Updated: June 15, 2020 11:46 pm</h4>
                <a href="./images/goblin-poster.png"><img src="./images/goblin-poster.png" alt="BLACKPINK Comeback Teaser Poster" title="BLACKPINK's 2020 comeback begins with a pre-release single set to drop on February 26, 2020."></a>
                <p>Aside from Moon Lovers Scarlet Heart Ryeo, this Korean drama also broke our hearts. The first few episodes gave us the kilig and funny moments between Ji Eun Tak and Kim Shin while it took us with a dramatic turn when we’ve find out the long history between Grim Reaper, Sunny, Kim Shin and Eun Tak.</p>
                <p>Let’s see if I can convince you with these 7 reasons on why you should watch (or maybe re-watch) Goblin or Guardian: The Lonely and Great God:</p>
                <h5>1. The casting seems like it was all ‘deity’s plan.’</h5>
                <p>This would be one of the dramas that I can say had the perfect casting. I love how the actors and actresses in this drama portrayed their character really well. Kim Go Eun, a lovely 19-year-old Ji Eun Tak is someone I would also help should I meet someone like her. I was also surprised to find out that Im Yoona’s character was a strict-yet-sweet unnie to Eun Tak, and loved how their characters bonded and grew up throughout the drama. Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook was a perfect fit for their characters. It was as if they were all meant for their roles.</p>
                <h5>2. You’ll get to appreciate the bonding between Deok Hwa and his 2 extraordinary Uncles.</h5>
                <p>Aside from the drama’s plot, you get to witness the story line of Yook Sung Jae’s character, Yoo Deok Hwa and his two samchons: Kim Shin and Kim Woo Bin. The relationship of this trio acted as a comic-relief as viewers will always keep a smiling face whenever these three shows up.</p>
                <h5>3. The adorable love stories.</h5>
                <p>Like the typical Korean dramas, love plots are somehow compulsory since it attracts a lot of viewers who love romantic dramas, and to those who identify themselves as romantics. In Goblin, we’ve witnessed a few types of love: romantic, friendship, and love for material things.</p>
                <p>Romantic with the budding love storyline between Eun Tak and Kim Shin, as well as Sunny and The Grimreaper.</p>
