                The clock is ticking as BLINKS have a very good reason to lose their s**t. After impatiently waiting for almost one and a half years, BLACKPINK is finally gearing up for their highly-awaited 2020 Comeback. Their last venture was the super successful Kill This Love EP, which released in April 2019. The three-part comeback kickstarts on June 26, when BLACKPINK's pre-release single from their first official untitled album will be dropped. Then, another track will drop in July or August with a special format. Finally, BLACKPINK's album will release in September 2020.</p>
                <p>While the pre-release single announcement was made a few days back, BLINKS were treated kindly today with four Comeback Teaser Posters with the members - Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rosé - featuring in them. What the fandom could not get over was the feisty hair colour changes in Jennie, Lisa and Rosé while Jisoo opted for chocolate brown hair and still rocked the simple look in a funky manner. As it's been a while since Jennie dyed her hair, fans were pleasantly surprised to see the rapper sport blond locks. Lisa looks fierce AF in her red avatar while Rosé's dazzling hair colour makes up for her hidden face in her poster.</p>

Rosé quipped that their comeback reminds her of a cat while Jennie added that she thought of King Kong. "If our music has been powerful and strong till now, our next song will focus more on a hip-hop aura with swag," Jisoo concluded.</p>
